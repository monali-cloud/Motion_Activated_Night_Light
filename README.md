# Motion_Activated_Night_Light
Arduino-based motion-activated night light built during CEW Workshop at MIT-ADT University.

This project was created during the CEW Workshop at **MIT-ADT University (1st Year)**.  
It uses an **Arduino UNO**, **PIR motion sensor**, and **LED** to automatically turn on a night light when motion is detected.

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino UNO  
- PIR Motion Sensor  
- LED  
- Resistors and Breadboard  

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle
When the PIR sensor detects motion, it sends a signal to Arduino, which turns ON the LED for a few seconds.  
If no motion is detected, the light turns OFF automatically.
